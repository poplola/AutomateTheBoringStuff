/*
Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure like the one shown when given [1, 2, 3] as argument.
 Also write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. 
 Then add a helper function prepend, which takes an element and a list and 
 creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, and nth, 
 which takes a list and a number and returns the element at the given position in the list 
 (with zero referring to the first element) or undefined when there is no such element.
If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of nth.
*/
