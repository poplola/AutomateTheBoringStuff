<!--
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. 
At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
 # # # # 
# # # #
 # # # # 
# # # #
 # # # # 
# # # #
 # # # # 
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid
of the given width and height.

        for(let i=1; i<=row; i++){

            for(let j=1; j<=col; j++){
                if (i%2){
                    str += ' '+ chr
                }else{
                    str += chr + ' '
                }
            }
            console.log(str)
