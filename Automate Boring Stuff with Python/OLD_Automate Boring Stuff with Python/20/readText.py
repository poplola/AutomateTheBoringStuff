# Write a program that follows this procedure for copying the text from a windowâ€™s text fields. 
# Use pyautogui.getWindowsWithTitle('Notepad') (or whichever text editor you choose) to obtain a Window object. 
# The top and left attributes of this Window object can tell you where this window is, 
# while the activate() method will ensure it is at the front of the screen. 
# You can then click the main text field of the text editor by adding, say, 
# 100 or 200 pixels to the top and left attribute values with pyautogui.
# click() to put the keyboard focus there. 
# Call pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 'a') and pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 'c') to select all the text and copy it to the clipboard. 
# Finally, call pyperclip.paste() to retrieve the text from the clipboard and paste it into your Python program. 
# From there, you can use this string however you want, but just pass it to print() for now.
