# countdown.py - A simple countdown script.
"""
At a high level, hereâ€™s what your program will do: 
    1. Count down from 60.
    2. Play a sound file (alarm.wav) when the countdown reaches zero. 

This means your code will need to do the following:
    1. Pause for 1 second in between displaying each number in the countdown by calling time.sleep().
    2. Call subprocess.Popen() to open the sound file with the default application.

Open a new file editor tab and save it as countdown.py.
