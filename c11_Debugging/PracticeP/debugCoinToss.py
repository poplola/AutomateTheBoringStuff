# Debugging Coin Toss
"""
The following program is meant to be a simple coin toss guessing game. 
The player gets two guesses (itâ€™s an easy game). However, the program has several bugs in it. 
Run through the program a few times to find the bugs that keep the program from working correctly.

import random
guess = ''
while guess not in ('heads', 'tails'):
    print('Guess the coin toss! Enter heads or tails:')
    guess = input()
    toss = random.randint(0, 1) # 0 is tails, 1 is heads 
    if toss == guess:
        print('You got it!') 
    else:
        print('Nope! Guess again!') 
        guesss = input()
        if toss == guess:
            print('You got it!') 
        else:
            print('Nope. You are really bad at this game.')
